This is the third website I made during my Frontend Dev. studies at Noroff.

## Description

This site was made for my first project exam in my first year of studying Frontend Dev.. At this point we were tested in everything we had learned the whole year. The brief said we were going to make a blog, we could choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it had to at least have the following pages:
-	Home page
-	About page
-	List of blog posts
-	Blog post specific pages
-	Contact page.

## Built With
